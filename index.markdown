## Abstract

The latent space of generative AI models affords unique creative possibilities in the domain of creative AI for music and sound. While interface designs for latent space navigation typically rely on sound-producing gestures that involve bodily motions and movements, the underlying subjective perceptions of these gestures remain underexplored. To understand how musicians perceive sound-producing gestures and tailor them into performance techniques with audio latent space navigation, we present a workshop study of musicians' embodied exploration of a stylus and tablet interface embedded with an adapted latent space of a neural audio synthesis model.

---

**VO**: Verbal instructions
**AC**: Action items

(2mins) AC: Sign consent forms.
VO: Okay with photo-taking, data-logging, interview audio and video recording?

(1mins) VO: Research workshop, purpose: prototype, experience, explore, feedback.

(2mins) Check left/right hands, check connections

(2mins) Pre-task survey
Look at the computer screen in front of you...
VO: all written texts will be transcribed to text, anonymised, so you won't be able to recognise your handwriting. 
AC: check all finished

(5mins) Warm-up
We'll be sketching on the canvas a lot, so in the following warm-up:  
On the canvas below, use your pen to trace the patterns (sketching / pen-stroking techniques), and use your pen to try them out.  
While you're sketching, focus your attention on how your hand moves, focus on the movement, try to be steady, try different speeds and intensities, and focus on how your hand feels, what your hand feels like.  


```

**Body Scan Script:**  

The tablet you're using here is the instrument that we'll be soundwalking today. It's a tablet, the surface of the tablet is mapped to the canvas on your screen. It's currently blank but not an empty canvas; it has a sound terrain embedded in it. 

Body scan: an activity that focuses on relaxing and trying to focus your attention on specific body parts, in our case, the arm, wrist, and hands.

Sit comfortably, hold the pen, and close your eyes;
Take four to five very deep breaths;
Repeat;
Keep your eyes closed, allowing your breath to return to its natural rhythm;

Noticing how your body feels right now, with a sense of stillness or restlessness;

Now, let's do a body scan;
Scanning from your head (the top of your head);
gently moving to your neck;
moving to your shoulder;
both of your arms;
gently moving to your hand;

Focus your attention on the hand that is holding the pen;
Focus your attention on your wrist, on your hand, on the tip of your fingers;

And now, keeping your eyes closed,
Let's draw something.
Let the pen touch the tablet;
Let's start by moving very slowly;
And start with simple lines;
Notice how your hand moves, notice how your hand feels when you're drawing;
Now, let's draw a few circles;
Focus on the movement of your hand, focus on how it feels;
speed up a little bit, speed up but keep it steady, slow down a little bit;

Take a deep breath;

Now, let's try to move in a way that you feel smooth,   
moving smoothly, softly;  
move in a way that you feel rough;  
start to add a sense of harshness to it;  
Now let's go back to smooth.  

Now, let's move in a way that you feel light,
move in a way that you feel hard, that you feel heavy;

Try to move in a way that you feel constrained; the feeling of being constrained, limited in a space;
then try to move in a way that you feel free;
try to break out from that space, try to be free;

Now let's try to be precise, try to be precise, be aware of the location, try to be precise about the pressure, be precise about the speed;
Now let's try the opposite: try to feel loose, try to feel released; follow your instincts, follow your feelings. 

```

(20mins) Terrains

Try out a sketching technique on the canvas;  
Take note in the "Soundwalking Notes" section, click complete;  
Try a different sketching technique or the same technique at a different canvas location.   
Take another note, click complete;   
Repeat, until you get around 7~10 notes;  


In the following session:  
We'll be exploring the tablet instrument in front of you;  
The instrument has embedded four different sound terrains, which control how the AI model produces sound;  
While you're sketching on the canvas, you're traversing inside a terrain.  


(5mins)x3 Interview


Score:
For the next activity, let's create a score for each terrain

Explore the terrain again, and try to create a short piece of sound/loop that you feel is interesting.  
Draw graphical notes on the canvas to help you reproduce this short piece of sound/loop.  

Permanent Ink + Colours  
We provide a permanent type of ink with 4 colours, which will remain on the canvas until you click "Clear".  
Try it out here  


Here are two examples of scores, but feel free to get creative and explore other notations.


**Interview prompts:**  

What sound/ sonic materials have you discovered? Can you demonstrate them using sketches?   

Are these sketches included on the note-taking template? Reflecting on the note-taking template:   

Why did you choose this instrument?  

How would you describe the bodily experience while using this instrument?   

How did you discover the sonic materials you found?   

Could you explain the trajectory that you have drawn on the template?
